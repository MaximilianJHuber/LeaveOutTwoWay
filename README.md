# Updates

 * Version 1.1 (19June2017): Improved Eigenvalues/vectors calculations. Fixed other small bugs in `<leave_out_COMPLETE.m>`


# LeaveOutTwoWay
Leave Out estimates in two fixed effects models as described in Kline, Saggio and SÃ¸lvsten (2018).

Within this repository, there are three indepedent routines that users can test on their own
datasets:

Users interested in applying the homoskedastic correction in two-way
fixed effects models can use the function `<andrews_complete.m>`. 

Users interested in applying leave-out estimates in two-way
fixed effects models can use the function `<leave_out_COMPLETE.m>`.  

Users interested in computing leave-out estimates and inference 
of the variance of firm effects only can use the function 
`<leave_out_FD.m>` which works well with large datasets.

All is required for these functions to run appropriately is that the
original person-year file is appropriately sorted by worker-identifiers
and year.

Check the m-file `<main.m>` to run Leave Out estimates in a test sample.

# Brief Description

This repository computes Leave Out estimates of variance components in two fixed effects models as described in Kline, Saggio and SÃ¸lvsten (2018) - KSS henceforth - using Matlab.

The m-file `example.m` shows how to compute Leave Out estimates in a test dataset.

# Current Release: Version 2.0

 * Added option to estimate (Bii,Pii) using Random Projections methods that build on the Johnson Lindestrauss Lemma - See Appendix B of KSS.
 
 * This especially helpful in massive datasets where exact computation of (Bii,Pii), even after the improvements introduced from version 1.5, is close to be prohibitive in terms of computation time.
 
 * We have added the following inputs
                
                *   "type_of_algorithm": This takes two values: "exact or "JLL".

                           "type_of_algorithm = exact": performs exact computation of (Bii,Pii)
                           as described in version 1.5.          
                    
                           "type_of_algorithm = JLL": performs random projection methods to
                           approximate (Bii,Pii) as detailed in Appendix B of KSS.
                
               *    "epsilon": this governs the tradeoff b/w speed and accuracy 
                    when estimating (Bii,Pii). Smaller values of epsilon implies 
                    more accuracy but slower performance.

* In terms of speed, for a dataset with approx 50K workers, 15K Firms

                *  When "type_of_algorithm = exact", the code takes 1600
                   seconds to compute (Bii,Pii) for variance of firm
                   effects, variance of person effects and covariance of
                   person, firm effects. 
 
                *  When "type_of_algorithm = JLL" and `epsilon`=0.005, 
                   the code takes 100 seconds to compute (Bii,Pii) 
                   for variance of firm effects, variance of person effects 
                   and covariance of person, firm effects. 
 
                *  The estimates from JLL differ from those obtained with 
                   the exact algorithm by a factor less than 0.1.
 
# History of Updates

 * Version 1.51 (15August2018): Better management of large sparse matrices when invoking parfor to compute (Bii,Pii) using the option      `parallel.pool.Constant`.

 * Version 1.5 (14August2018): Improved "exact" computation of (Bii,Pii). In particular, we have introduced the following changes:
                
                * Added CMG routine to speed computation of linear system
                  involving the Laplacian matrix as design matrix. 
                
                * CMG package - available here: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkoutis/cmg.html - 
                  has been already included in the repository.
 
                * Read movers-stayers structure to fasten computation of (Bii,Pii).
                
  * In terms of speed, for the test dataset used in `example.m`
  
                * With version 1.32 the code takes 260 seconds to compute (Bii,Pii).
                
                * With version 1.5 the code takes 23 seconds to compute (Bii,Pii).
                
 * Version 1.32 (01JAug2018): Introduced example.m with better management of folders where results are saved. `leave_out_COMPLETE.m` now                               also exports a .csv file containing the main variables in the leave out connected set
 * Version 1.31 (31Jul2018): Added the option "DO_SE" in main.m.
 * Version 1.3 (25Jul2018): Dropped stayers with a single person-year observations (for whom Pii=1 when estimating model in levels).
 * Version 1.2 (01Jul2018): Added more options to speed-up computation of the standard errors.
 * Version 1.13 (22June2018):Better read of Nargout options. Added option if user wants computation of standard error.
 * Version 1.12 (20June2018): Fixed minor bugs when running leave out estimation with controls. 
 * Version 1.1 (19June2018): Improved Eigenvalues/vectors calculations. Fixed other small bugs in `leave_out_COMPLETE.m`
 * Version 1.0 (16June2018): Original upload. 

# Routines included within the Repository.
Within this repository, there are three independent  routines that users can test on their own
datasets:

* Users interested in applying the homoskedastic correction in two-way
fixed effects models can use the function `andrews_complete.m`. 

* Users interested in applying leave-out estimates in two-way
fixed effects models can use the function `leave_out_COMPLETE.m`.  

* Users interested in computing leave-out estimates and inference 
of the variance of firm effects only can use the function 
`leave_out_FD.m` which works well with large datasets.

All that is required for these functions to run appropriately is that the
original person-year file is sorted by worker-identifiers
and year (xtset id year in Stata).

# Things to have in mind 

* `example.m` provides a simple example where the user calls a test dataset in .csv and then calls the function `leave_out_COMPLETE.m` to compute leave out estimates. See the documentation provided within the function of `leave_out_COMPLETE.m` for a description of the inputs and the outputs associated with this function.

* `leave_out_COMPLETE.m` outputs estimates of the VCM of the person, firm effects with associated standard errors (assuming q=0 in KSS).  Standard errors for the case q=1 can also be obtained. In future releases, we plan also to allow users to specificy the variance component associated with a specific (sub)set of controls. 

* Adding Controls to the model: This is easily handled by `leave_out_COMPLETE.m`. However, to speed up computations, we suggest to partial out the effects of these controls in a first step so that the associated design matrix has a Laplacian structure. See the documentation provided inside the functions `leave_out_COMPLETE.m` and `leave_out_FD.m` and Appendix B of KSS.

* It is highly suggested that the user runs any of the function mentioned above on an hpc system in order to fully exploit the parallelization features of Matlab.

* Code runs on any type of person-year file (balancend-unbalanced), the only important thing is that the variables in memory (outcome variable, worker identifiers, firm identifiers, eventual controls) need to be sorted by worker id and year.
